        <p className="text-gray-400">
          In no event shall NB1 or its suppliers be liable for any damages
          (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or
          due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to

          authorised representative has been notified orally or in writing of
          the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not
          allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability
          for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not
          apply to you.
